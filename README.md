The main objective of the project is to create an online book store that allows users to search and purchase a
book online based on subject. The selected books are displayed in a tabular format and the user can order their
books online through credit card payment. Using this Website the user can purchase a book online instead of going
out to a book store and wasting time. There are many online book stores like Powellâ€™s, Amazon which were designed
using Html. I want to develop a similar website using .HTML,CSS,JAVASCRIPT. Online Book store is an online web
application where the customer can purchase books online. Through a web browser the customers can search for a
book by its subject, later can place order in website and finally purchase using credit card transaction. 
The user can login using his account details or new customers can set up an account very quickly.
They should give the details of their name, contact number and shipping address. The user can also give feedback 
to a book by giving ratings on a score of five. The books are divided into many categories based on subject like 
Crime,Action,Romace,Comedy etc. The Online Book Store Website provides customers with online shopping through a web browser.
A customer can, create, sign in to his account, place items into a shopping cart and purchase using his credit card details.
